I tried to combine elements from assignment 6, typography, as I only have 20 minutes before the deadline of turn in for the semester and dont think I can finish that one! uuuggghh! After doing this assignment I wish I made my final project-3 all 1970s funk-tastic. This is much more pleasing and fun to my eyes, hehehe.

Thanks again,
