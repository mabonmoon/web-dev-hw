# Kimberly Pierson Assignment 2

Version Control System is a system that keeps a detailed history of all the changes that have happened. It helps with collaboration as each personâ€™s changes are saved and it  makes it easy to merge. Its a great system of organization, and logging history states helps with fixing errors without destorying the code. Makes sense we're using this in this class to stay clean and backtrack within our work.
