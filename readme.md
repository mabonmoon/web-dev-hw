# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.

## Kimberly Pierson

I've always been interested in web design and development, but can't seem to move past relying on website builders. I know that templates take a lot of the grunt work out of the way, but I want to be able to go in and customize as I see fit without being lost in translation of the code. I am also a Media Arts online student, so it goes with the territory I have chosen to study :)

- that we are connected globally via the internet through cables beneath the sea.

- the hidden web invisible to search engines. How mysterious.

- Seeing the one second on the web internet statistics displaying how many tweets, tumblr posts, skype calls, emails send, or emoji's used happening every second. Oof.

- The TED talked touched on the psychology of the world inside of the screen and the external world surrounding us. Since the internet is 'physical' thing then I'm interested in how this makes the nature of reality more and more complicated.
