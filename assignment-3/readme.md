# Kimberly Pierson / Assignment 3

- A page can only have one <head> and <body> element. The <head> role is a container for high-level information for a site including the pages format and style and this information is not visible, whereas the <body> is the container in which all displayed and viewable content is set up and held within.

- Structure is the more overarching format and layout of a page, whereas Semantic defines a pages intended nuances within such as emphasis to text through italics.

- Getting more and more familiar with the myriad of tiny meticulous details within HTML. It is fun. This week wasn't too bad. I am excited to learn about CSS so that I can manipulate fonts... I am weary of times new roman.
